# RSIR-Reinforcement-Learning-and-SDN-Intelligent-Routing

An approach, called RSIR, for KDN (KDN) by adding a Knowledge Plane based on RL (RL) in SDN. RSIR defines an RL-based
routing algorithm that considers link-state metrics to explore, learn, and exploit efficient routing paths even under
dynamic traffic changes. This algorithm capitalizes on the interaction with the environment (RL) and the global view of
the network (SDN), to proactively install, in advance, routes that meet traffic demands. This proactive approach allows
the reduction of the latency in calculating and installing routes in traditional SDN. RSIR has extensively been
evaluated by emulation using real traffic matrices from the GÃ‰ANT network. Results demonstrate that RSIR outperforms
Dijkstra-based routing algorithms with dynamic link costs (i.e., delay or loss), when considering the stretch of routing
paths, delay, loss, and used bandwidth in the network as metrics of comparison.
